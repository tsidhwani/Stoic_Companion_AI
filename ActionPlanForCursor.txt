I am going to work on a project for this in Cursor, I need to start prompting it in the right direction. I need you to conglomerate what I have told you so far so I can feed it to Cursor's LLM:. Combine the things below in the ways i describe to give me a detailed, yet digestable first prompt for cursor to build the repo for my app.

take the idea from this prompt, with all the key details and information but without the deep research aspects: 

I need you to do market research on an AI Stoic assistant. I want to create a mobile app that is a fine tuned LLM based on Marcus aurelius, seneca, and epictetus. It should have all of their teachings, and be based on meditations by marcus aurelius, letters of a stoic by seneca, and more. Basically, I want people to be able to get guiding, stoic principles and apply those to their modern problems. 

For example, at a high level, if someone is upset about a cancelled flight, my assistant should remind them to only focus on responses to external events, and to try to discern between what is in our control and what is not. I need you to make an outline for me, like a set of instructions, that contains what platforms/tools/services I will need to be able to make this happen. I hope to release this as an app on the Apple app store, and I have done a bit of research already to see that similar websites/apps already exist. Mine should be different in that it helps users grow as a stoic, and not only gives them the stoic principle to guide them through that particular problem, but helps them grow past that. 

Part of your job is to do analysis on the current market/apps and figure out several ways I could go that would differentiate my AI stoic companion from the rest of the field. Your final output should be a thorogh set of instructions on how I would code up and deploy this app, the tools and platforms I would use for each step of the way, and the ways I could go from here to make my app unique. Each step of this guide should be very detailed, I should be able to refer to this and get this done in a few weeks


combine it with the idea of having a library of famous philosophers texts like aeurelius, seneca, and epictetus. 

I really like the ideas of points 1/2 in the section of opportunities for differentiation. focus on / mention those. 

the rest of the plan is good to have, but won't be needed in this initial prompt. That is more for me, the human orchestrator, of this project. focus on things here that the ai implementing it needs to know, the backend implementation / front end softwares required is a great example

Got it — you basically want a compressed but rich first prompt for Cursor that:

Captures your AI Stoic Assistant concept clearly.

Keeps the focus on technical implementation + core product features.

Incorporates your idea for a library of philosopher texts.

Highlights your favorite differentiation points (points 1 & 2 from the “opportunities for differentiation” section).

Leaves out the heavy market research & human orchestration details.

Here’s a Cursor-ready starter prompt you can drop in as your initial instruction:

Prompt for Cursor:

I want to build a mobile app called AI Stoic Companion — an AI-powered assistant that uses a fine-tuned LLM based on the works of Marcus Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic), and Epictetus (Enchiridion and Discourses). These works are in the public domain and should form a core searchable and indexed library inside the app.

Core functionality:

User can chat with the assistant to get Stoic-based guidance for modern problems.

AI identifies the underlying principle from Stoic philosophy and applies it to the user’s specific situation.

In addition to resolving the immediate question, the assistant offers a short daily/weekly growth exercise that helps the user internalize the principle over time (differentiation point 1).

AI also tracks a user’s philosophical growth via progress markers, summaries of learned principles, and reflections over time (differentiation point 2).

Backend requirements:

Fine-tuned or instruction-optimized LLM trained on parsed, cleaned Stoic texts + supporting philosophical commentary.

Vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus) for semantic search over the philosopher text library.

API layer (Node.js or Python FastAPI) to handle requests between mobile client and AI model.

Cloud hosting on AWS or GCP (Lambda/Cloud Functions for serverless execution, S3/Cloud Storage for text library & embeddings).

Frontend requirements:

Mobile app built in React Native (cross-platform iOS + Android) or SwiftUI (iOS first).

Chat UI with streaming AI responses (like ChatGPT mobile).

Library section with full-text search and category browsing (e.g., “Control vs. Not in Control”, “Virtue”, “Death”, “Resilience”).

Progress tracker dashboard for showing completed lessons and principles learned.

Technical flow:

User enters question → request sent to backend.

Backend retrieves relevant Stoic passages from vector DB and passes them to LLM for context.

LLM returns guidance + optional growth exercise.

Guidance and exercises stored in user’s profile for tracking over time.

Goal for Cursor:

Generate the full repo structure for this app with backend + frontend skeletons, integration points for LLM, vector database setup, and API endpoints.

Include placeholder code for the Stoic text ingestion & embedding pipeline.

Implement minimal working chat UI with hardcoded responses (to be replaced by LLM integration later).

If you want, I can also append a ready-made repo folder structure so Cursor starts coding with the right architecture from day one. That would make this even smoother. Do you want me to prepare that?
